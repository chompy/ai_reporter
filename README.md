# AI Reporting Library
**Created by Nathan Ogden for Contextual Code**

This is still a WIP. I'm currently cleaning up and consoladating code from other repositories.

This tool allow you to create AI generated reports based on information collected from code bases (via Gitlab/Github) and a web browser controlled by the AI via Selenium. Reports will be able to be chained together based on the results of previous reports in a workflow system.
